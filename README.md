# React defaultProps lab

## Objectives

1. Practice defining components with default props
2. Override default props with your own prop values

## Overview

We want students to practice what they learned in the previous lesson.

The narrative here can really be anything — make it fun, zany, a little out
there — because, again, students probably won't have a super hard time with
this.

Just make sure that they also get practice setting props explicitly to override
the defaults.
